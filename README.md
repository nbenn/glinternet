# Local development
For previewing local changes to this page, a Jekyll instance is required. To install Jekyll, both Ruby and Bundler are required. If those dependencies are met, run the command `bundle install`.
To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run Jekyll with Bundler. Use the command `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch for project repositories), and your site should be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
